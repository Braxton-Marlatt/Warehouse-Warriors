    This prefab is designed to be placed in each scene of the game in order to provide both music and sound effect functionality.
    It operates by searching through the Assets->Resources folder for audio clips to be added to AudioSource objects.

    Each Sub-manager has a mixer that can be assigned to it through the Unity editor. This allows for granular control of the audio levels of each audio clip relative of each other.
