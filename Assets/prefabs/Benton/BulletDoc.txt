Using the Bullet prefabs:


What this prefabs contains:
    - Sprite image of cookie
    - Rigid Body 2d for physics
    - Box collider for detecting collisions
    - Script controlling bullet behavior logic
    - 

How to use:
    This object is intednded to be used by a shooting method. This bullet will be called to instantiate when the player shoots.
    On this object there are tags to determine collisions and the event to handle. For the target tag you will populate this with 
    the target the bullet is trying to hit. Such as "enemy" so that it knows what to do when the bullet hits an object wiht this tag. 
    For the player bullet it will retrive the health component attached to the enemy the bullet collides with and call the hurt() function.
    It also will check for collisions with the playing area as long as you fill the obstacle tag field with the tag that all of your 
    walls and boundary of your game have. When a collision is detected with this object it will simply just destroy the current bullet
    object. There is also a damage field in this script but this is going to be defined when the shoot() fucntion is called. This allows
    for more robust combat mechanics as the bullet damage can change based on the person shooting and the abilities they posses.
